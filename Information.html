						"The Amazon is a vast region that spans across eight rapidly developing countries: Brazil, Bolivia Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, Venezuela, Guyana, Suriname and French Guiana, an overseas territory of France.The landscape contains: One in ten known species on Earth 1.4 billion acres of dense forests, half of the planet 's remaining tropical forests 4, 100 miles of winding rivers 2.6 million square miles in the Amazon basin, about 40 percent of South	America There is a clear link between the health of the Amazon and the health of the planet.The rain forests, which contain 90 - 140 billion metric tons of carbon, help stabilize local and global climate.Deforestation may release significant amounts of this carbon, which could have catastrophic consequences around the world.",

							<h3>In relation to us?</h3>
							<p>"Carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere causes the world to heat up. The Amazon is one of the worldâ€™s
								most important natural buffers for keeping us cool with forests that cover 5.5 million acres.
								<br> <br> Source : <a href="https://amazonaid.org/why-should-you-care/">AmazonAid</a>
								Inside the Amazon is one of the worlds largest resevoirs of Carbon Dioxide, the same stuff that is warming up
								the Earth. And with each tree that falls more of it is released into the air. And with the fires recently, the
								carbon dixode just goes back up. Since most trees are 80+ years old ( <a
									href="https://www.livescience.com/3979-ancient-trees-amazon.html">Live Science</a> ) and every 40 years the tree absorbs
								10 more tonnes of CO2. ( <a href="https://projects.ncsu.edu/project/treesofstrength/treefact.htm">North Carolina State University</a> ) It can be thought that majority of the trees burning are releasing ate least 20 tonnes of CO2, each. A huge number when you realize that all the trees are falling pretty fast.

							<h3>What exactly is happening?</h3>
							<p>It's hard to find good quality news, especially ones that are real time and relevant, so while we are posting news form CNN, please be aware that this news is not the full news and as with anything, finding more sources for information is the way to go.</p>

								<h4><a href="https://www.cnn.com/americas/live-news/amazon-wildfire-august-2019/index.html">Wildfires rage in
										the Amazon: Live updates</a></h4>
								<p>By Meg Wagner and Mike Hayes, CNN Updated 4:24 p.m. ET, August 23, 2019 The Amazon is on fire: Wildfires
									continued to burn at a record rate in Brazil's Amazon rainforest. The cause: Environmental organizations
									and researchers say the wildfires were set by cattle ranchers and loggers who want to clear and utilize
									the land, emboldened by the country's pro-business president.</p>

							<h3>They beat you</h3>
							<p><strong>And surprisingly it's a good thing</strong> As of today many countries have vowed to help the Amazon. As of 2019, out of the 5.5 million km2 of the Amazon, nearly 1.75 million km2 is resgistered as "conservation land". As of June 2019, Oil companies can no longer mine for oil in the Amazon, and they have place heavy fines for Oil mining. Peru has invested a large amount of money into animal rehabilitaion. So far the Amazon Conservation Team has mad esignificant strides in Columbia, Suriname and Brazil.</p>
