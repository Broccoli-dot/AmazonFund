# AmazonFund

We are a group of students attending high school in Canada wanting to make a difference and help save the Amazon. On a trip in late 2016, we visited the Amazon and were blown away by the beauty to the forest. It hurts to know that that very forest is depleting as we speak and that we aren’t doing much about it. For this reason we, as a group decided that WE needed to make a difference and get the community involved. We had to act fast. In fact the very first version of this site launched just 2 days after this idea was conceived. And as a starting organisation, we didn't have much money to spend on websites, so this entire website had to be built by hand!

Seeing as there was little to no help coming in from Canada, and a lot of government work had backfired. We decided to go through NGO’s, after all they seem to have more influence in the region. And after careful consideration, we also knew that there had to be steps we could take to prevent such a thing from happening again. Therefore we also allow users to sign a pledge, to ensure that governments will take action to prevent such a thing form happening.

We are working to help eradicate and PREVENT the Amazon Fires, for more info please check out our site at [amazonfund.ca](amazonfund.ca)
