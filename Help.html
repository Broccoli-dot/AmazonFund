						How can YOU help? Although there aren’t many ways you can help the Amazon directly, you have the power to help those who
						can. Large organizations such as the Rainforest Action Network say that a donation of just $25 is enough to protect and
						save an acre of land from becoming damaged. By funding larger organizations you can help
						make a difference. A donation of even $5 can go a long way. <strong>Just scroll down!</strong>

							<h3>How do we rank organizations</h3>
							<p>The truth is we don't. The only problem with ranking organizations, is the soft side of ranking. We can't rank how much effort they have put, or how good their intentions are. Because frankly, there's a lot of information not available to us right here. And giving someone a score based on something we don't knwo is wrong. Therefore we give you all the information we have access to. In the fore of Charity Watchdogs. They have the manpower to look through all their financial statements, and of course rank how well they are. Here's their Wikipedia, discussing this in far more detail than we could.</p>

							<h3>Pragmatic views</h3>
							<p>There is a stark difference between optimism and pragamatism, and so we realistially we must follow what will work. And so far as even some of the biggest governments fail to work their influence, it really makes you question weather all of this will actually work. And the short answer is yes it does. For every dollar given to ngo's we're showing both the government of Brazil and many others that the population wans a better and much more impactful delivery of the promises.</p>
